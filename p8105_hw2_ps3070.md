First, I will load the `tidyverse` and `readxl` libraries.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Problem 1
---------

To read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel .xlsx file, I will: \* import the data \* specify the sheet in the Excel file \* omit non-data entries \* use reasonable variable names \* omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data \* round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using `as.integer`)

``` r
data_trashwheel = read_excel(
  "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N338") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate("sports_balls" = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

Only cells from A2 to N338 are imported because column O contains notes and row 1 only contains a figure and no data.

To clean up names of the data to snake case, I used `janitor::clean_names()`.

The grand totals are included within the dataset. To omit rows that are dumpster-specific, I omitted rows that included these grand totals. Under the row `dumpster`, I dropped any rows that were recorded as `NA`/without data.
